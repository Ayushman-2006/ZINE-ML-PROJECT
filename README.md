## Stage 0(cleaning the data)

### 1)Load the Dataset:

Use pd.read_csv() to load the data file(csv file) into a pandas DataFrame.

Explore the Dataset:

**df.head()**: Displays the first 5 rows to understand the structure.

**df.info()**: Shows column names, data types, and missing values.

**df.describe()**: Provides statistical summaries for numerical columns.

### 2)Handle Missing Values:

Check for missing values with isnull().sum().
Fill missing values:
For categorical columns: Use the mode (most frequent value).
For numerical columns: Use the mean.

### 3)Encode Categorical Variables:

Identify categorical columns using select_dtypes(include=["object"]).
Apply one-hot encoding to convert them into numerical features, ensuring they can be processed by machine learning models.

### 4)Normalize Numerical Features:

Use MinMaxScaler to scale numerical features between 0 and 1 for better model performance.

### 5)Save the Preprocessed Dataset:

Save the cleaned and transformed dataset as a CSV file for use in the next stages.
# Stage 1
## Decision Tree in Machine Learning
A Decision Tree is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It works by repeatedly splitting the dataset into subsets based on feature values, aiming to create "branches" that lead to a decision or prediction.

How Does a Decision Tree Work?

Root Node:

The top of the tree where the splitting process begins.
It represents the entire dataset.

Splitting:

At each node, the algorithm chooses a feature and a threshold value to split the data into subsets.
The goal is to maximize the separation of classes (for classification) or minimize variance (for regression).

Decision Nodes:

Intermediate nodes where further splits occur.

Leaf Nodes:

The terminal nodes that contain the final output (e.g., a predicted class for classification or a value for regression)

DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42):

Initializes a Decision Tree classifier.

random_state=42 ensures reproducibility (so the tree splits the same way every time).
.fit(X_train, y_train):

Trains the model using the training data (X_train) and the corresponding labels (y_train).
